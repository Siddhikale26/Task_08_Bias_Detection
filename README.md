Research Task 08: Bias Detection in LLM Narratives

This project investigates different types of bias (Framing, Confirmation, Demographic, and Selection) in LLM-generated narratives using controlled experiments and structured prompts.

Project Overview
We use a set of engineered prompts on a controlled dataset (SU Women's Lacrosse Statistics and Player Profiles) and evaluate the responses of GPT-4o to detect bias presence.

 Structure
- `prompts/`: All prompt templates categorized by bias type.
- `scripts/`: Python code to generate and analyze responses.
- `outputs/`: Raw LLM response data in JSON format.
- `analysis/`: Summary, visualizations, and computed bias metrics.
- `report/`: Final PDF report with detailed findings and methodology.
